    jobTitle: "Software Development Engineer",
    jobDescription: `We are currently looking for an experienced Software Development Engineer to join our team. The ideal candidate is excited about the incredible opportunity that cloud computing represents, and is passionate about delivering high quality services in a hyper-growth environment where priorities can shift fast. As a member of our team, you'll work alongside outstanding engineers and leaders, refine product requirements with product and program managers, define architecture, and be a leader in the implementation and launch of software.

      All team members actively participate in product definition, technical architecture review, iterative development, code review, and operations. Along with this, you’ll have the opportunity to interact with enterprise customers to ensure their needs are met -- clear, professional communication with teammates and customers is an important part of the job.
      
      Cloud computing represents a fundamental shift in how businesses think about managing their information needs. While this emerging area of computing has seen tremendous growth over the past few years, we are still in the early stages of realizing its full potential. We're looking for a smart, passionate and detail oriented engineer to help us continue to define this exciting new technology.
      
      Key job responsibilities:-

        You solve difficult problems, applying appropriate technologies and best practices.
        You work with your team to invent, design and build software that is stable and performant.
        You are proficient in a broad range of design approaches and know when it is appropriate to use them (and when it is not). Your solutions are pragmatic.
        You consider the legacy of the code you produce and write code that an SDE unfamiliar with the system can understand.
        You limit the use of short-term workarounds. You do things with the proper level of complexity the first time (or at least minimize incidental complexity).
        You create flexible software without over-engineering. You make appropriate trade-offs, re-use where possible, and are judicious about introducing dependencies.
        You are efficient with resource usage (e.g., system hardware, database, memory/CPU, etc.)
        You work on project ideas with customers, stakeholders, and peers`,
